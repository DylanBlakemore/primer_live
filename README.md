# PrimerLive

An implementation of GitHub's [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/design) for Phoenix LiveView and regular (non-LiveView) views in Phoenix applications.

PrimerLive provides a strong base for creating data driven applications such as rich CRUD applications with interactive forms that integrate with Phoenix Forms, Ash Forms and Ecto Changesets.

Menus and dialogs allow for in-page viewing and editing of data, without leaving the current page. Alternatively, menus and dialogs can be invoked when visiting a specific route.

Components (and their inner elements) can be styled with custom CSS, or by passing pre-made utility classes.

Right-to-left languages are supported.
